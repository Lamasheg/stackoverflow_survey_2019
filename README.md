## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interestested in using Stack Overflow data from 2019 to better understand:

1. What are the distributions of females with respect to country, ethnicity, level of education, etc?
2. What are the challenges that females are facing in tech field? 
3. What does the data suggest of males and females in terms of salary and working hours? 
4. What factors associat with high salary, eg. education level, major, etc.?


## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There is a notebooks available here to showcase work related to the above questions.  The notebooks is exploratory in searching through the data pertaining to the questions showcased by the notebook title.  Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.  

There is an additional `.py` file that runs the necessary code to obtain the final model used to predict salary.
